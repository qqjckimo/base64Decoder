# Base64 Image Decoder and Pixel Analysis Tool

üñºÔ∏è A powerful web-based tool for decoding Base64 encoded images and performing detailed pixel analysis.

## Features

### üîç Base64 Image Decoding
- Decode Base64 encoded images from data URLs or raw Base64 strings
- Support for multiple image formats: PNG, JPEG, GIF, WebP
- Real-time image display and analysis

### üìä Comprehensive Pixel Analysis
- **Image Information**: Display dimensions, format, file size, and total pixel count
- **Color Statistics**: Count unique colors and analyze dominant colors
- **Brightness Analysis**: Calculate average brightness of the image
- **Interactive Pixel Inspection**: Click on any pixel to view detailed color information
- **Color Format Support**: RGB, HEX, and HSL color representations
- **Transparency Analysis**: Detect and count transparent pixels

### üé® Advanced Color Features
- Dominant color extraction with percentage breakdown
- Color preview swatches
- Hover effects for pixel-level color inspection
- Real-time pixel coordinate and color display

## How to Use

1. **Open the Tool**: Open `index.html` in any modern web browser
2. **Input Base64 Data**: 
   - Paste your Base64 encoded image string into the text area
   - Supports both data URLs (e.g., `data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0...`) and raw Base64 strings
3. **Decode**: Click the "üîç Ëß£Á¢º‰∏¶ÂàÜÊûê" (Decode and Analyze) button
4. **Analyze**: View the decoded image and explore the detailed pixel analysis
5. **Interact**: Click on any pixel in the image to see its color information
